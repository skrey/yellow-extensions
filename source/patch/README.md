## How to make a patch

Edit the [code with patches](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-extensions/blob/master/source/patch/patch.php). This will show you what can be done to convert old files and settings. Patches are included in the [update process](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-extensions/tree/master/source/update). First the updater downloads latest extensions and patches. Then the updater applies the patches and after the website is up to date the patches will be deleted. Upload your changes to GitHub, let us know if you need help.
