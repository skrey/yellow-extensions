## How to use the command line

Open a terminal window. Go to your installation folder, where the file `yellow.php` is. Type `php yellow.php` to show available commands. The available commands depend on extensions installed. Type `php yellow.php about` to show the current version and extensions. If you don't have PHP on your computer, [see PHP installation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php).

## How to build a static website

You can build a static website at the command line. The biggest difference between a static website and a normal website is that a static site generator builds everything in advance, instead of waiting for a file to be requested. Open a terminal window. Go to your installation folder, where the file `yellow.php` is. Type `php yellow.php build`, you can optionally add a folder and a location. This will build a static website in the `public` folder. Upload the static website to your web server and build a new one when needed. To check for broken links type: `php yellow.php check`. To clean the static website type: `php yellow.php clean`.

If you don't want that a page is built, set `Build: exclude` in the [page settings](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-extensions/tree/master/source/core#settings-page) at the top of a page.

## How to build a static cache

You can build a static cache at the command line. The static cache supports a normal website by building some files in advance and storing them in the file system. You can also think of it as combining the features of a static website and a normal website. Open a terminal window. Go to your installation folder, where the file `yellow.php` is. Type `php yellow.php build system/cache`. This will build a cache in the `system/cache` folder. Build a new cache when needed. To clean the cache type: `php yellow.php clean system/cache`.

If you don't want that a page is built, set `Build: exclude` in the [page settings](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-extensions/tree/master/source/core#settings-page) at the top of a page.
